##Helper module for working with Erlang Proplist and Map representations of JSON

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jr0senblum/jwalk.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/jr0senblum/jwalk)
[![hex.pm version](https://img.shields.io/hexpm/v/jwalk.svg)](https://hex.pm/packages/jwalk)

This work is a partial re-wrte of [ej](https://github.com/seth/ej) but focuses 
on Map and Proplist representations of JSON - the type returned by
[jsone](https://github.com/sile/jsone), for example. Anything that is good about
this is due to him, anything bad is completely my fault.
###Dependencies
Erlang 17.0 +

Builds with rebar3 or Hex

No other dependencies, the src code is a single file.

###QuickStart
##### clone
$ git clone git://github.com/jr0senblum/jwalk.git

$ cd jwalk

#### compile
$ make compile

#### run tests
$ make eunit

#### dialyze
$ make dialyze

#### Erlang shell
$ make start

1> jwalk:get({"one"},#{<<"one">>=>1}).

##Functions
The following functions are implemented where Path is a tuple representation of a 
javascript-like path (see below) and Obj is a Map or Proplist representation of JSON:

* ``jwalk:delete(Path, Obj)`` - Remove the value from Obj, at the location specified by 
Path, and return a new Map or Proplist.
* ``jwalk:get(Path, Obj)``, ``jwalk:get(Path, Obj, Default)``  - Return the value from Obj
at the specificed Path, or undefined or Default.
* ``jwalk:set(Path, Obj, Val)`` - Set a value in an Object and return the new structure.
* ``jwalk:p_set(Path, Obj, Val)`` - Set a value in an Object creating intermediate nodes 
as necessary returning the new strcutre

##Paths
In jwalk, paths into JSON objects are expressed using a tuple of keys or Path elements.

The Path elements can be thought of as a tuple represention of a javascript-like 
path: i.e.,

``Obj.cars.make.model``  would be expressed as ``{"cars","make","model"}`` , as in
``jwalk:get({"cars","make","model"}, Obj)``.

In addition to Names, a Path element can be

* An integer index, or the atoms ``first`` and ``last`` which will select elements of a 
JSON ARRAY 
* ``{select, {"name","value"}}`` which will select a subset of JSON objects from an
Array having a Member ``{"Name": Value}`` 

For example

	Cars = [{<<"cars">>, [ [{<<"color">>, <<"white">>}, {<<"age">>, <<"old">>}],
                           [{<<"color">>, <<"red">>},  {<<"age">>, <<"old">>}],
                           [{<<"color">>, <<"blue">>}, {<<"age">>, <<"new">>}]
                         ]
           }].

 Then 

	1> jwalk:get({"cars", {select {"age", "old"}}}, Cars).
	[[{<<"color">>, <<"white">>}, {<<"age">>, <<"old">>}],
       [{<<"color">>, <<"red">>},   {<<"age">>, <<"old">>}]]

    2> jwalk:get({"cars", {select, {"age", "old"}}, 1}, Cars).
    [{<<"color">>,<<"white">>},{<<"age">>,<<"old">>}]

    3> jwalk:get({"cars", {select, {"age", "old"}},first,"color"}, Cars).
    <<"white">>

###Usage Examples
Given:

    Obj = #{<<"widget">> => 
            #{<<"debug">> => <<"on">>,
              <<"image">> => 
                  #{<<"alignment">> => <<"center">>,
                    <<"hOffset">> => 250,
                    <<"name">> => <<"sun1">>,
                    <<"src">> => <<"Images/Sun.png">>,
                    <<"vOffset">> => 250},
              <<"keys">> => [],
              <<"text">> => 
                  #{<<"alignment">> => <<"center">>,
                    <<"data">> => <<"Click Here">>,
                    <<"hOffset">> => 250,
                    <<"name">> => <<"text1">>,
                    <<"onMouseUp">> => <<"sun1.opacity = (sun1.opacity / 100) * 90;">>,
                    <<"size">> => 36,
                    <<"style">> => <<"bold">>,
                    <<"vOffset">> => 100},
              <<"values">> => [1,2,3,4,5],
              <<"version">> => <<"1">>,
              <<"window">> => 
                  #{<<"height">> => 500,
                    <<"name">> => <<"main_window">>,
                    <<"title">> => <<"Sample Konfabulator Widget">>,
                    <<"width">> => 500}}}.

or 

    Obj2 = [{<<"menu">>,
         [{<<"id">>,<<"file">>},
          {<<"value">>,<<"File">>},
          {<<"popup">>,
           [{<<"menuitem">>,
             [[{<<"value">>,<<"New">>},{<<"onclick">>,<<"CreateNewDoc()">>}],
              [{<<"value">>,<<"Open">>},{<<"onclick">>,<<"OpenDoc()">>}],
              [{<<"value">>,<<"Close">>},
               {<<"onclick">>,<<"CloseDoc()">>}]]},
            {<<"titleitem">>, []}]}]}].

then: using jwalk:get(Paths, Object)
    
    1> jwalk:get({"widget"}, Obj).
    {<<"debug">> => <<"on">>,
     <<"image">> => #{<<"alignment">> => <<"center">>,
                  <<"hOffset">> => 250,
                  <<"name">> => <<"sun1">>,
                  <<"src">> => <<"Images/Sun.png">>,
                  <<"vOffset">> => 250},
	 <<"keys">> => [],
	 <<"text">> => #{<<"alignment">> => <<"center">>,
    	             <<"data">> => <<"Click Here">>,
        	         <<"hOffset">> => 250,
            	     <<"name">> => <<"text1">>,
                	 <<"onMouseUp">> => <<"sun1.opacity = (sun1.opacity / 100) * 90;">>,
             	    <<"size">> => 36,
                	 <<"style">> => <<"bold">>,
                 	<<"vOffset">> => 100},
 	 <<"values">> => [1,2,3,4,5],
	 <<"version">> => <<"1">>,
 	 <<"window">> => #{<<"height">> => 500,
     	              <<"name">> => <<"main_window">>,
        	           <<"title">> => <<"Sample Konfabulator Widget">>,
            	       <<"width">> => 500}}


	2> jwalk:get({"widget", "values"},Obj).
	[1,2,3,4,5]


	3> jwalk:get({"widget", "values", last},Obj).
	5

	4> jwalk:get({"menu", "popup","menuitem",{select,{"value","New"}}},Obj2).
	[[{<<"value">>,<<"New">>}, {<<"onclick">>,<<"CreateNewDoc()">>}]]

	5> jwalk:get({"menu", "popup","menuitem",{select,{"value","New"}},"onclick"},Obj2).
	[<<"CreateNewDoc()">>]
