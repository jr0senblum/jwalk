##Helper module for working with Erlang Proplist and Map representations of JSON

This work is a partial re-wrte of [ej](https://github.com/seth/ej) but focuses 
on Map and Proplist representations of JSON of the type returned by
[jsone](https://github.com/sile/jsone). I have lifted a lot of
his verbiage and tried to follow his API.

The following functions are implemented:
* ``jwalk:delete/2``, ``jwalk:delete/3``  - Remove the value at the location.
  specified by `Path' and return the new Map or Proplist representation.
* ``jwalk:get/2``, ``jwalk:get/3``  - Return a value from Object or undefined 
  (or default).
* ``jwalk:set/3`, ``jwalk:set/4`` - Set a value in an Object.
* ``jwalk:p_set/3`, ``jwalk:_set/4`` - Set a value in an Object creating 
intermediate nodes as necessary.

In jwalk, paths into JSON objects are expressed using a tuple of keys or Path elements.

The Path elements can be thought of as a tuple represention of a javascript-like 
path: i.e.,

``Obj.cars.make.model``  would be expressed as ``{"cars","make","model"}`` , as in
``jwalk:get({"cars","make","model"}, Obj)``.

In addition to Names, a Path elemente can be: </br>
* An integer index or ``first`` and ``last``: Elements of a JSON ARRAY can be accessed 
by using an integer index or the atoms ``first`` and ``last``
* A subset of JSON objects in an ARRAY can be selected using ``{select, {"name","value"}}``

For example

	Cars = [{<<"cars">>, [ [{<<"color">>, <<"white">>}, {<<"age">>, <<"old">>}],
                           [{<<"color">>, <<"red">>},  {<<"age">>, <<"old">>}],
                           [{<<"color">>, <<"blue">>}, {<<"age">>, <<"new">>}]
                         ]
           }].

 Then 

	1> jwalk:get({"cars", {select {"age", "old"}}}, Cars).
	 [ [{<<"color">>, <<"white">>}, {<<"age">>, <<"old">>}],
       [{<<"color">>, <<"red">>},   {<<"age">>, <<"old">>}]
     ]


Given:

    Obj = #{<<"widget">> => 
            #{<<"debug">> => <<"on">>,
              <<"image">> => 
                  #{<<"alignment">> => <<"center">>,
                    <<"hOffset">> => 250,
                    <<"name">> => <<"sun1">>,
                    <<"src">> => <<"Images/Sun.png">>,
                    <<"vOffset">> => 250},
              <<"keys">> => [],
              <<"text">> => 
                  #{<<"alignment">> => <<"center">>,
                    <<"data">> => <<"Click Here">>,
                    <<"hOffset">> => 250,
                    <<"name">> => <<"text1">>,
                    <<"onMouseUp">> => <<"sun1.opacity = (sun1.opacity / 100) * 90;">>,
                    <<"size">> => 36,
                    <<"style">> => <<"bold">>,
                    <<"vOffset">> => 100},
              <<"values">> => [1,2,3,4,5],
              <<"version">> => <<"1">>,
              <<"window">> => 
                  #{<<"height">> => 500,
                    <<"name">> => <<"main_window">>,
                    <<"title">> => <<"Sample Konfabulator Widget">>,
                    <<"width">> => 500}}}.

or 

    Obj2 = [{<<"menu">>,
         [{<<"id">>,<<"file">>},
          {<<"value">>,<<"File">>},
          {<<"popup">>,
           [{<<"menuitem">>,
             [[{<<"value">>,<<"New">>},{<<"onclick">>,<<"CreateNewDoc()">>}],
              [{<<"value">>,<<"Open">>},{<<"onclick">>,<<"OpenDoc()">>}],
              [{<<"value">>,<<"Close">>},
               {<<"onclick">>,<<"CloseDoc()">>}]]},
            {<<"titleitem">>, []}]}]}].

then: using jwalk:get(Paths, Object)
    
    1> jwalk:get({"widget"}, Obj).

          #{<<"users">> => [#{<<"location">> => <<"Germany">>,<<"name">> => <<"sebastian">>}]}


Notice that delete/3, set/3, set_p/4 take a final parameter of the atom 
'proplist' and these functions return Proplist representations. This is
necessary becuase certain uses of these functions are ambiguous with 
respect to whether Map or Proplist representations are being contimplated by the
user. The sister functions/ delete/2, set/2 and set_p/3, return Map 
representations.
